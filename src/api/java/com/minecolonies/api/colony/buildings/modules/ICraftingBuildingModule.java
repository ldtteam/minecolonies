/**
 * This module represents the ability for a building to generate
 * items via some form of crafting, whether vanilla, smelter, or
 * some entirely custom process.  It also supports (within some
 * restrictions) automatic JEI integration to let the player look
 * up which items can be produced at each building.
 *
 * A single building may have more than one of these, but in that
 * case they must be linked to different jobs (or to no job) and
 * you have to more carefully manage the learned recipe list.
 *
 * Note that (somewhat uniquely among modules) while there is a
 * "real" one of these attached to the building on the server
 * side that can hold state, additional instances can also be
 * created (with a null building) on the client side in order to
 * answer abstract (but building-type-specific) questions for JEI.
 * When called this way, it must be able to provide answers
 * completely stateless with no expectation that the building
 * (or any colony, for that matter) actually exists.
