MineColonies is a colony simulator within Minecraft! There are numerous types of workers, and each worker has its own type of hut, letting you build a busy and vibrant village/town/city/colony. There is no coded limit to the number of NPC's at your disposal, so you can create a small, efficient village dedicated to a particular type of worker or a sprawling metropolis with hundreds of workers. It's entirely up to you!
