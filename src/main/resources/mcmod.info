  "description": " MineColonies is a Colony/Town Simulator that adds many structures and NPC workers and guards that you control and put to work for you! Based around a townhall and village mechanic, there are numerous workers that can be added to your colony, building a busy and vibrant village/town/city within Minecraft. There is no coded limit to the number of NPC's at your disposal, so you can create a small efficient Village dedicated to a particular type of worker, or a sprawling metropolis with many workers. \n It's entirely up to you!
