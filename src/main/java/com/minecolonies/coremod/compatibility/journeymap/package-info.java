/**
 * # About JourneyMap integration
 *
 * Two integrations are currently supported:
 *
 * 1. Colony chunks/borders are highlighted
 * 2. Deathpoints are added when a citizen dies
 *
 * Since JourneyMap is an optional dependency, it is absolutely forbidden
 * for any class outside of this package to call into this package.
