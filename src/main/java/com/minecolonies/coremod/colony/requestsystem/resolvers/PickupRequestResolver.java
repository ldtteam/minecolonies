/**
 * Resolver that handles pickup requests. Pickups don't have much logic inherently, because the only important information are the requester and the priority. These resolvers are
 * supposed to be provided by deliverymen.
 * <p>
 * Currently, this resolver will iterate through all available deliverymen and find the one with the least amount of open requests, followed by the one that is nearest.
 * <p>
 * There is a tiny bit of (known) code-smell in here, since this resolver should either be global or specific to a hut. Currently, it is a hut-specific resolver that acts as if it
 * were global. The performance impact is negligible though.
