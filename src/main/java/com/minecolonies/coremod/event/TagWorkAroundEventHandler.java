/**
 * Handles forge events specifically focused around mitigating Minecraft Forge behavior for tags on remote clients.
 * Minecraft/Forge synchronizes some tag information to remote clients from servers automatically, but (as of 36.1.2)
 * does not update the TagCollectionManager and ItemTags tag suppliers to use these new data sources.
 * As a result, any remote use of these tag suppliers will return inconsistent results.
 * The data is important to support ModTagsInitializer and CompatibilityManager, as well as any use of crafter tag rules.
 * While we currently don't use tags often on the client, moving more and more information to the data pack system /will/ cause problems.
 *
 * The event handlers themselves are good uses for this case, but their interactions are hacky,
 * primarily because of timing problems between CompatibilityManager and smelting recipes.
 * If Forge changes its behavior for TagCollectionManager and ItemTags, some of the logic in here can be cleaned up and moved to normal FooEventHandlers.
 *
 * For Single Player, startup pattern is :
 *  -- onTagUpdate (populate ModTagsInitializer) -> onServerStarted (populate CompatibilityManager and FurnaceRecipes)-> onRecipesUpdate (repeat FurnaceRecipes).
 * For Dedicated Servers, startup pattern is :
 *  -- onTagUpdate (populate ModTagsInitializer) -> onServerStarted (populate CompatibilityManager and FurnaceRecipes).
 * For Remote Clients either connecting to Open To Lan Single Player, or a Dedicated Server, startup pattern is :
 *  -- onRecipesUpdated fires (populates FurnaceRecipes) -> onTagUpdate fires (populates CompatibilityManager and ModTagsInitializer).
 * Data Pack Reloads during live play will fire onTagUpdate in all cases.
