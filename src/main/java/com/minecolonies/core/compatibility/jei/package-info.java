/*
 * # About JEI Plugin
 * The JEI plugin currently provides two separate features of significance:
 *
 * Firstly, as part of the recipe-teaching system, it facilitates looking up a recipe in JEI and then clicking the
 * recipe as a whole into the crafting grid (even when the player does not have the corresponding items, as this is
 * just ghost-crafting) so that it can be taught to a building.
 *
 * Secondly, it provides a way to look up which colony buildings will accept various recipes, either to be taught
 * or as natively supported products.
