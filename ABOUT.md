# About MineColonies 
MineColonies is an interactive building mod that allows you to create your own thriving town within Minecraft. It lets your leadership skills soar by providing you with everything you need to build your kingdom. MineColonies gives you the flexibility to create a colony as unique as every player. With so many options, you'll create a different colony every time, adapt it to any biome, build inside a mountain, on top of one, under the ocean, or in the sky.

The limit is your imagination!

MineColonies features NPC workers such as Builders, Farmers, Fishers, Foresters, Guards, Miners, Smelters, Bakers, Cooks, Couriers, five types of animal herders, Composters, and many more, with even more being developed and added as the mod grows.

It also includes specialized buildings such as the Warehouse, House, Town Hall, Barracks, Library, University, and even the School.

### Governance
You have full control of how to build your town. You determine how many workers you want or need, what type of workers, where they will live, and hire or fire as you see fit, creating a colony at your own pace. It is your village to design and develop; you are the designer, administrator, and boss.

### Security
Your colony deserves the best security you can have. Strategically add Guard Towers or Barracks Towers so Guards will protect your city from hostile mobs and new types of raiders that will attack on random nights.

### Replenishment
Your citizens need to be fed well. Keep a Farmer or an animal herder to supply the Baker and the Cook so no one goes hungry. Make sure to hire Couriers to take food (and other materials) from place to place.

### Have Fun, Play with Friends
MineColonies has a very powerful multiplayer system. The permission system allows for collaborative team play in multiplayer where you can assign different roles in a colony such as Officer, Friend, Neutral, and Hostile! You can also have competing colonies at the same time, all with a strong protection system for server management and anti-griefing. Fun for all!
