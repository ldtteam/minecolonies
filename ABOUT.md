Minecolonies is an interactive Town building mod that allows you to create your own thriving Town within Minecraft.

Featuring many NPC workers such as: Builders, Crafters, Farmers, Fishermen, Guards, Barracks, Miners, Smeltery, Baker, Cook/Restuarant, Deliveryman, Animal Herders and many more planned for development. As well as a specialized buildings such as: Warehouse, Citizen Huts and a Townhall. Minecolonies gives you the ability to create a colony as rich and unique as every player.

### Governance
You have full control of how to build your Town. You determine how many workers you want or need, what type of workers, where they will live, and hire or fire as you see fit. Creating a Town at your own pace. It is your Town to design and develop, you are the designer, administrator and boss. 

### Security and Replenishment
Your Town deserves the best security you can have. Strategically add Guard Towers or Tower Barracks to protect your Town from hostile mobs and barbarians that will attack in random nights. Give them the best weapons and armour your Town has to offer. They need to be fed well to work and protect it better. Keep a busy farmer to supply the baker and the cook at the restaurant, so no one goes hungry. 

### Have fun, Play with Friends
Minecolonies has a very powerful multi-player system and an awesome tool for learning about Town planning, building and especially management. The permission system allows for collaborative team play in multi-player where you can assign different roles in a Town such as; Officer, Friend Neutral or even Hostile! Also have individual competing colonies at the same time, all with a strong protection system for server management and Anti-Griefing. Fun for all!
